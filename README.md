# Tau Hypercomputing Facility
## Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) service container

This project builds a container image for operating a [Heimdal](https://www.h5l.org) Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC).

### Usage

It is assumed that you are generally familiar with operating a Kerberos KDC.

Note that in the examples below, the `kadmin` service is explicitly bound to (IPv4) `localhost` (127.0.0.1). On the container host, you can use `kadmin -a 127.0.0.1 ...` to force a `kadmin` connection to `localhost`.

####  Normal KDC operation

```
$ mkdir -p /opt/kerberos/db
$ docker run \
    -e REALM=MYREALM \
    -p 88:88/tcp -p 88:88/udp \
    -p 464:464/udp \
    -p 127.0.0.1:749:749/tcp \
    -v /opt/kerberos/db:/app/db \
    tauproject/kdc:shimmer
```

If this is the first time the container has been run with a realm database will be created in `/opt/kerberos/db/MYREALM` (in this example). An `admin/admin@MYREALM` principal will be created and granted access to use  `kadmin`; the password for this principal is written to `/opt/kerberos/db/MYREALM/admin-pw`.

#### Local `kadmin` mode

```
$ docker run -it \
    -e REALM=MYREALM \
    -v /opt/kerberos/db:/app/db \
    tauproject/kdc:shimmer kadmin
```

The container will shut down once you exit `kadmin`.

### Caveats & limitations

1. Change the `admin/admin` password (or delete the principal altogether) and remove the `admin-pw` file from the realm database directory  once the realm has been created.
2. There is no provision for importing data from an existing KDC database.
3. Replication configuration is not currently orchestrated.
